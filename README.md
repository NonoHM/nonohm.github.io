# nonohm.io - NonoHM personal website

This is my website where I will post some contents like my projects and posts/writeups.
This portfolio is a modified and personalized version of the really nice Jekyll Theme [Al folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).
Thus, this is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) builded static website.

Please feel free to visit or use these tools to make your own, but don't forget to see mine üòè.
