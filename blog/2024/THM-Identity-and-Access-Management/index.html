It starts with a user claiming an identity, like a username, an email address…</li> <li> <strong>Authentication</strong> is the process of ensuring the user is the one he pretends to be. This can be made through passwords, SSO, one-time codes…</li> <li> <strong>Authorization</strong> determines what rights the user has to access to something. This process is usually done by assinging roles and permissions to an acocunt and normally, the only ones the user needs to perform his actions.</li> <li> <strong>Accountability</strong> tracks the user’s activity to ensure who is responsible for what. This is typically done by logging all the user activity and storing it in a centralized location.</li> </ol> <p>IAAA helps prevent unauthorised access, data breaches, and other security incidents. By implementing these best practices, organisations can protect their sensitive information and resources from internal and external threats.</p> <h3 id="questions">Questions</h3> <p><strong>You are granted access to read and send an email.

This is made through a unique number, name, email address…</p> <p>Howerver, without a proper authentication system, anyone can claim to be anything, like giving a fake identity.</p> <h3 id="questions-1">Questions</h3> <p><strong>Which of the following cannot be used for identification?</strong></p> <ol> <li>Email address</li> <li>Mobile number with international code</li> <li>Year of birth</li> <li>Passport number</li> </ol> <p><em>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code></em></p> <p><strong>Which of the following cannot be used for identification?</strong></p> <ol> <li>Landline phone number</li> <li>Street number</li> <li>Health insurance card number</li> <li>Student ID number</li> </ol> <p><em>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code></em></p> <h2 id="task-4---authentication">Task 4 - Authentication</h2> <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the user’s identity. Idenficitation and Authentication are core components of any information system and network. It is essential to understand the difference between authentication and identification.</p> <p>This process is usually accomplished through one of the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Something you know</strong>: Password, OTP/OTC…</li> <li> <strong>Something you have</strong>: License dongle, card…</li> <li> <strong>Something you are</strong>: Biometrical informations like fingerprint or face recognition.</li> </ul> <p>Two other methods are less used but can also be taken in account:</p> <ul> <li>Somewhere you are (logical/physical location).</li> <li>Something you do (behaviour).</li> </ul> <h3 id="multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3> <p>MFA refers using <strong>two or more</strong> of the above mechanisms. The purpose is to add a security in case one of it is compromised like a password getting hacked but using MFA, to access to the account, an authenticator code is needed.</p> <h3 id="questions-2">Questions</h3> <p>Answer the following questions using the correct item number from the numbered list below.</p> <ol> <li>Something you know</li> <li>Something you have</li> <li>Something you are</li> <li>2FA</li> </ol> <p><strong>When you want to check your email, you enter your username and password.

What phase is this decision part of?</strong></p> <p><em>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code></em></p> <h2 id="task-6---accountability-and-logging">Task 6 - Accountability and Logging</h2> <p><strong>Accountability</strong> ensure the users, once authorised to access a system, can be held responsible for their actions. This is possible if there is <strong>auditing</strong> capabilities, which requires <strong>logging</strong>.</p> <h3 id="logging">Logging</h3> <p>Logging is the process of recording events that occur within a system. This process includes user actions, system events, and errors. By logging user actions, an organisation can maintain a record of who accessed what information and when. This record is vital for regulatory compliance, incident response, and forensic investigations.</p> <p>A comprehensive logging system can identify anomalies and alert or take actions over them if configured for.</p> <p>Logs should be <strong>tamper-proof</strong> in order to not be deleted, that is why a separate logging server is a good practive in a network.</p> <p><strong>Log forwarding</strong> is the process of sending log data from one system to another. This process often aggregates log data from multiple sources into a central location for more accessible analysis and management.</p> <p>By centralizing log data, potential security threats can be more easily identified by analysing and correlating collected log events.</p> <h3 id="logging-and-siem">Logging and SIEM</h3> <p>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a technology that aggregates log data from multiple sources and analyses it for signs of security threats. SIEM solutions can help organisations identify anomalies, detect potential security incidents, and provide alerts to security teams.</p> <p>SIEM and logging also provides benefits such as compliance reporting and forensic investigations. Compliance reporting helps meet reporting requirements by collecting data necessary for audits. Forensic investigations are crucial in identifying the source and cause of a security incident and need a detailed system and network activity history.</p> <h2 id="task-7---identity-management">Task 7 - Identity Management</h2> <p>Identity Management (IdM) includes all the necessary policies and technologies for IAAA. It ensures that only authorised people have access to the needed assets and resources for working properly while unauthorized people are being denied.</p> <p>IdM helps in the tasks of:</p> <ul> <li>Protecting sensitive data</li> <li>Complying with regulations</li> <li>Simplifying user access process</li> <li>Improving UX (User Experience)</li> <li>Reducing costs</li> </ul> <p>IdM must be implemented correctly with effective strategies to ensure these rules are respected.</p> <p>Sometimes, IdM and Identity and Access Management (IAM) can be used interchangeably. However, some sources state that IdM tend to be more focus on Authentication and Permissions with users, devices and group management while IAM is more concerned with evaluating attributes and permissions for granting or denying access.</p> <h3 id="identity-management-idm">Identity Management (IdM)</h3> <p>IdM is the essential cybersecurity component that refers to the process of managing and controlling digital identities. It involves:</p> <ul> <li>Authentication</li> <li>Authorization</li> <li>Access Control</li> </ul> <p>The main goal is to ensure the access of authorized individuals only. They are use to manage user identities across an organization’s network.</p> <p>IdM systems use a centralized database to store identities and access rights. IdM systems generally include features such as user provisioning, authentication, and authorisation. User provisioning refers to the process of creating and managing user accounts, while authentication and authorisation refer to verifying the identity of a user and granting access to specific resources.</p> <p>To resume, IdM simplifies the user identity and access management by centralizing it.</p> <h3 id="identity-and-access-management-iam">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h3> <p>IAM is like subcategory of IdM. It works with the IdM but it focuses more on identity and access management. It ensures that only authorized users have access to specific resources. It also monitors and controls access.</p> <p>It is a comprhensive and secure solution to access to ressources by providing various technologies like role-based access control, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Single Sign On (SSO).</p> <p>IAM help organization comply with regulatory requirements such as <a href="https://www.hipaaguide.net/hipaa-for-dummies/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HIPAA</a> or <a href="https://www.hipaaguide.net/gdpr-for-dummies/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GDPR</a>. they provide functionnalities to manage lifecycle of user identities, including onboarding, offboarding, and access revocation.</p> <p>To clarify, IdM systems manage user identities, while IAM systems encompass broader functions to manage and secure digital identities and access rights.</p> <h3 id="questions-4">Questions</h3> <p><strong>What does IdM stand for?</strong></p> <p><em>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Identity Management</code></em></p> <p><strong>What does IAM stand for?</strong></p> <p><em>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Identity and Access Management</code></em></p> <h2 id="task-8---attacks-against-authentication">Task 8 - Attacks Against Authentication</h2> <p>In the real world and even in the digital world, having a passphrase to enter somewhere is almost impossible to be secure without cryptography because it can be known by unwanted people.</p> <h3 id="replay-attack">Replay Attack</h3> <p>A user log in on a page and the password is encrypted. Unfortuantely, the attacker uses the encrypted version and can login to the account.</p> <h3 id="unique-challenge-response">Unique Challenge Response</h3> <p>An encrypted password with always the same value is easy to circumvent. One approach would be to send an encryption of the current time along with the password. It requires for both parts to synchronize their clocks and ensures the response is only valid for a brief time. This is one way to do it and although it is not that secure, authentication protocols are beyond the scope of this room.</p> <h3 id="question">Question</h3> <p><strong>The attacker could authenticate using the user’s response when the authentication protocol required a password encrypted with a shared key. What is the name of the attack?</strong></p> <p><em>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Replay Attack</code></em></p> <h2 id="task-9---access-control-models">Task 9 - Access Control Models</h2> <p>A system controls access to various resources based on the chosen model. Somme of the common ones are:</p> <ol> <li>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</li> <li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</li> <li>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</li> </ol> <h3 id="discretionary-access-control">Discretionary Access Control</h3> <p>DAC is the fact of explicitely giving permissions to users. This is mainly used on sharing plateforms/file access and on a small scale because this process is very straightforward and fully controled by the data owner.</p> <h3 id="role-based-access-control">Role-Based Access Control</h3> <p>RBAC uses an intutive approach of control. Each user has one or more roles, furthermore they are authorized to access different ressources based on their roles. Authroization and access will be granted based on the group the user belongs to.</p> <p>This approach makes maintenance more manageable and efficient by adding or removing roles if needed.</p> <h3 id="mandatory-access-control">Mandatory Access Control</h3> <p>MAC prioritize security and significantly limit users’ abilities. In other words, users do not need to carry out tasks beyond the strictly necessary like install new software.</p> <p>SELinux or AppArmor are great exemples of MAC on Linux ditributions.</p> <h3 id="questions-5">Questions</h3> <p>Answer the following questions using the correct item number from the numbered list below.</p> <ol> <li>DAC</li> <li>RBAC</li> <li>MAC</li> </ol> <p><strong>You are sharing a document via a network share and giving edit permission only to the accounting department.
