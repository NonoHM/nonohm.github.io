## Task 1 - Introduction  

In cybersecurity, where in malicious actors relentlessly endeavour to exploit vulnerabilities in highly-sensitive systems, we have to combat these threats with a comprehensive approach to information security governance & regulation.
Such an approach requires establishing robust policies and guidelines and implementing rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance

### Learning Objectives  

* Understanding the role and importance of governance and regulation in cyber security
* Gain an understanding of relevant international laws, regulations, policies, standards & guidelines
* Understanding Governance, Risk Management & Compliance (GRC) framework
* Develop & raise own cyber security posture as per international standards, including ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and many more

## Task 2 - Why is it important?  

### Important Terminologies

1. **Governance**: Managing and directing an organization/system to achieve its objectives and ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and standards.
2. **Regulation**: A rule/law enforced by a gorvening body to ensure compliance and protect against harm.
3. **Compliance**: The stat of adhering to laws/regulations/standards that apply to an organization/system.

### Information Security Governance

Information Security Governance represents an organization's established structure, policies, methods and guidelines designed to guarantee the privacy, reliability and accesibility of its information assets.  

To keep away unauthorized intrusion, an ISG should falls under the following processes:

- **Strategy**: Developing and implementing a comprehensive information security strategy that aligns with the organisation's overall business objectives.
- **Policies and procedures**: Preparing policies and procedures that govern the use and protection of information assets.
- **Risk management**: Conduct risk assessments to identify potential threats to the organisation's information assets and implement risk mitigation measures.
- **Performance measurement**: Establishing metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the information security governance program.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices.

### Information Security Regulation

Information security regulation refers to legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the use and protection of information assets.
Regulations are designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, theft, and misuse. GDPR in Europe is one of the many standards available out there.

### Key Benefits

* More robust security posture with releveant regulation compliance.
* Increased stakeholder confidence by proving implemented measures.
* Regulatory compliance to avoid legal and financial penalties.
* Better alignment with business objectives to ensure cost-effective security measures.
* Informed decision-making to se where security measures are the most needed.
* Competitive advantage by enhancing stakeholders trust.

*Answer: `Risk management`*

**Is it important to monitor and measure the performance of a developed policy?  (yea/nay)**

*Answer: `yea`*

## Task 5 - Privacy and Data Protection

In every sector, privacy and data protection regulations are critical as they deal with citizens' Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
Privacy regulations help ensure PII is handled and stored responsibly and ethically to establish trust between clients and actors.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

[GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) is a data protection law implemented in 2018 in the EU. It applies to all business entities that conducts business in the EU and collect/stor/process data of EU residents. Companies can only collect personal data for a legitimate reason and must inform the owner about its processing. The three key points are:

* **Prior approval** must be obtained before collecting any personal data.
* Personal data should be kept to a **minimum** and only collected when necessary.
* **Adequate measures** are to be adopted to protect stored personal data.

If these are not respected, penalties and fines could be charged against the company:

- **Tier 1**: Unintended data collection, sharing data with third parties without consent, etc. Maximum penalty amounting to 4% of the organisation's revenue or 20 million euros.
- **Tier 2**: Data breach notifications, cyber policies, etc. The maximum fine for Tier 2 is 2% of the organisation's revenue or 10 million euros.

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

[PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) is focused on maintaining secure card transactions and protecting against data theft and fraud. It requires strict control access to cardholder information and monitoring unauthorised access, using recommended measures such as web application firewalls and encryption. Online card-based transactions are the main target for this regulatory.

### Questions

**What is the maximum fine for Tier 1 users as per GDPR (in terms of percentage)?**

*Answer: `4`*

**In terms of PCI DSS, what does CHD stand for?**

*Answer: `CHD`*

## Task 6 - NIST Special Publications

### NIST 800-53

[NIST 800-53](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) is a publication titled "Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organisations" developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. It serves as a framework fo organizations to assess and enhance the security and privacy of their information systems and comply with various laws, regulations, and policies.

NIST 800-53 Revision 5 organises security controls into twenty families, each addressing a specific security concern category.  

{% include figure.liquid path="/assets/img/images/thm_governance_&_regulation/B1PdVo4Ap.png" title="NIST 800-53 Key Points" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 bg-white" %}

### Implmenting NIST 800-53

**Program Management** is one of the most crucial point of the framework. It dictates establishing, implementing, and monitoring organisation-wide programs for information security and privacy while safeguarding the processed, stored, or transmitted through systems. These subcontrols needs to be implmented:

{% include figure.liquid path="/assets/img/images/thm_governance_&_regulation/Hyv1LoERT.png" title="PM Controls" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 bg-white" %}

### Compliance Best Practices

In order to comply to the best practices, businesses must follow these steps:

1. Discover and classify data assets, information systems, and associated threats.
2. Map these into the various NIST 800-53 families to create a structured approach for matching the organization's demands easier.
3. Manage governance structure by allocating duties to each family and outline them using access control
4. Monitor data activity and user behaviour regularly and avaluate to ensure compliance.

### NIST 800-63B

This special publication sets guidelines to help establish effective digital identity practices. It focuses on verifying indentities of individuals and giving levels of identity assurance. It offers adivces on using authentication factors, including passwords, biometrics, and tokens, and securely managing and storing user credentials.

### Questions

**Per NIST 800-53, in which control category does the media protection lie?**

*Answer: `Physical`*

**Per NIST 800-53, in which control category does the incident response lie?**

*Answer: `Administrative`*

**Which phase (name) of NIST 800-53 compliance best practices results in correlating identified assets and permissions?**

*Answer: `Map`*

## Task 7 - Information Security Management and Compliance

**Information Security** (IS) management is the panning, execution and continuous administration of security measures. It **protects information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, interruption, alteration, and destruction**.
To achieve that, it involves risk assessment and identification, security controls and procedures development, incident response planning, and security awareness training.  

**Compliance** refers to **observing information security-related legal, regulatory, contractual, and industry-specific standards**. 

### ISO/IEC 27001

[ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) is a standard for requirements to plan, develop, run, and update an organisation's Information Security Management System (ISMS).

It has the following core component:

* Scope
* Information security policy
* Risk assessment
* Risk treatment
* Statement of Applicability for controls
* Internal audit
* Management review

{% include figure.liquid path="/assets/img/images/thm_governance_&_regulation/rJLpb34AT.png" title="ISO 27001 Benefits" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 bg-white" %}

### Service Organisation Control 2 (SOC 2)

[SOC2](https://soc2.co.uk/) was developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as a compliance/auditing framework. It focuses on data security based on CIA triad.

This framework is essential for service providers interacting with client data or offering solutions that process, store, or transmit sensitive data. 
The primary purpose of the SOC 2 audit is to ensure that third-party service providers store and process sensitive information securely.

Here are the main points on what the audit will be conducted:

{% include figure.liquid path="/assets/img/images/thm_governance_&_regulation/BkhEE3NCT.png" title="SOC2 Main Points" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 bg-white" %}

Technical and specific controls, like ensuring data encryption in transit, network security, incident management, etc... can also be reviewed.

### Questions

**Which ISO/IEC 27001 component involves selecting and implementing controls to reduce the identified risks to an acceptable level?**

*Answer: `Risk Treatment`*

**In SOC 2 generic controls, which control shows that the system remains available?**

*Answer: `Availability`*

## Task 8 - Conclusion  

Here, we have seen a comprehensive overview of the importance of developing an effective information security governance & regulation framework to protect an organisation's valuable assets and sensitive information. We also have viewed laws and regulations about privacy and data protection such as GDPR and PCI DSS. The GRC framework concept has been explained  in order to develop a secure organization's outlook.

Furthermore, we have highlighted different governance enablers, such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST 800-53, and NIST Special Publication 800-63B, and explained how they provide information security protection to an organisation.
