Nice to meet you, I'm Noah and welcome to my personal website.  
I am currently a 3rd year student in the "BUT Réseaux & Télécommunications" program. I like doing sports, music and practicing languages besides learning new things in IT.

I will post most of my writeups and my projects here, enjoy !
